> listmonk is **alpha** software and may change and break. Use with caution. That said, it has been in active use at [zerodha.com](https://zerodha.com) for several months where it has processed hundreds of campaigns and tens of millions of e-mails.

listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. It is fast, feature-rich, and packed into a single binary. It uses a PostgreSQL database as its data store.

### Installation and use

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases) and extract the listmonk binary somewhere.
- Run `./listmonk --new-config` to generate a sample `config.toml` and add your configuration (SMTP and Postgres DB credentials primarily).
- `./listmonk --install` to setup the DB.
- Run `./listmonk` and visit `http://localhost:9000`.
- Since there is no user auth yet, it's best to put listmonk behind a proxy like Nginx and setup basicauth on all endpoints except for the few endpoints that need to be public. Here is a [sample nginx config](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/wiki/Production-Nginx-config) for production use.

### Running on Docker

You can pull the official Docker Image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/listmonk/listmonk).

You can checkout the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to get an idea of how to run `listmonk` with `PostgreSQL` together using Docker.

- `docker-compose up -d app db` to run all the services together.
- `docker-compose run --rm app ./listmonk --install` to setup the DB.
- Visit `http://localhost:9000`.

Alternatively, to run a demo of listmonk, you can quickly spin up a container `docker-compose up -d demo-db demo-app`. NOTE: This doesn't persist Postgres data after you stop and remove the container, this setup is intended only for demo. _DO NOT_ use the demo setup in production.
